    The lock is installed for **this worker's card group**, not for the whole
    ``--device`` list, so under ``--device-group-size`` each group is its own
    lane: the workers sharing a group take turns on its cards while the rest
    compile, and groups never wait on each other. It must agree with the
    ``device_ids`` fixture, which is why both go through ``harness.cards``.

    Installed unconditionally: with one worker the lock is uncontended and costs
    a file open per dispatch, and it still keeps two concurrent runs that were
    lent the same cards from driving them at once. See ``card_lock`` for what the
    guarded region deliberately excludes and why.

    ``--codegen-only`` layers its own patches over these per test, so no lock is
    taken on a run that never reaches a card.

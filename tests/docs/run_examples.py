"""Run the example ladders on the simulator, several at a time.

Every example must compile AND run with a passing golden, so the teaching
material cannot silently rot. Two ladders are covered:

- ``examples/distributed`` — run at the default rank pair, plus every alternate
  mode and rank count the walkthroughs document. A documented invocation that
  nothing runs is teaching material nobody checks.
- ``examples/{beginner,intermediate,advanced,utils}`` — the manual's
  beginner/intermediate/advanced/utils citations. They default to ``a2a3sim``
  and take no arguments.

Each invocation is an independent process: its compile output goes to a fresh
``mkdtemp`` under ``build_output``, its reusable binaries are guarded by
``binary_context_lock``, and a distributed run's shared-memory segment is named
after its own driver PID (``comm_sim.cpp``'s ``make_shm_name``). Nothing is
shared, so ``--jobs`` simply runs N of them at once.

``--jobs`` defaults to 1: the width belongs to the caller, who knows what else
the machine is doing. CI passes it explicitly.

Usage:
    python tests/docs/run_examples.py [--jobs 16] [-p a2a3sim]
    python tests/docs/run_examples.py --list        # show what would run
